Steps:
1. Initialize the project with below command,
	npm init --yes : Creates a package.json in our project 

	Note: npm init command will create package.json file in our project

2. Install babel as a development dependency with below command,
	npm i babel-cli@6.26.0 babel-core@6.26.0 babel-preset-env@1.6.1 --save-dev

	Note: 1. That means we won't be supplying that into our production
      	      2. Go to the project directory from command prompt of your computer
                   E:
                   cd es6-tooling

	package.lock.json - It's internally used by npm
	Babel-cli is a command line interface which we run from command line. We'll give it the name of javascript file and it will convert or compile that javascript code.
	Babel-core is basically a core of babel where all the logic for transpiling code is implemented.
	Babel-preset : Is a combination of all the new javascript features plugin

3. Create a javascript file with some es 6 style of code

4. Change package.json scripts section to add babel command as below
	"scripts": {
		"babel": "babel --presets env index.js -o build/index.js"
	}

	Note: 
	1. Here, we're saying put all the transpiled code inside build directory of project
	2. Create build directory in your project

5. Run below command to transpile the code,
	npm run babel
